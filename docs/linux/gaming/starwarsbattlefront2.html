i am using the lutris-fshack-6.21-6-x86_64 version of wine, any version should work though

esync and fsync are enabled

before i used the wine desktop so i could run the game launch command from within the wine cmd

to circumvent this, i use a .bat file inside battlefronts wine prefix and run it via the linux terminal while origin is running

WINEESYNC=1 WINEPREFIX=/run/media/duncanf/382808f9-c795-49e0-ada4-1ae02e9594c7/Games/star-wars-battlefront-ii-2017 /home/duncanf/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/lutris-fshack-6.21-5-x86_64/bin/wine64 /run/media/duncanf/382808f9-c795-49e0-ada4-1ae02e9594c7/Games/star-wars-battlefront-ii-2017/drive_c/users/Public/Desktop/swbf2.bat

this achieves more or less the same effect as running it in the wine desktop cmd however comes with none of the drawbacks of the desktop environment

all that is next is to configure dwm to make origin float by default (would also fix jedi fallen order)
